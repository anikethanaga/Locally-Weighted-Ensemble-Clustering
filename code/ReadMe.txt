There are mainly two types of materials in this directory:
1. A pool of 100 base clusterings for each dataset (in the data directory);  
2. The code of the LWEA and LWGP algorithms  (in the code directory).

About the data:

The base clustering pools for the 15 datasets are provided in the following MAT files:

baseClsPool_Caltech20.mat
baseClsPool_FCT.mat
baseClsPool_IS.mat
baseClsPool_ISOLET.mat
baseClsPool_LR.mat
baseClsPool_LS.mat
baseClsPool_MF.mat
baseClsPool_MNIST.mat
baseClsPool_ODR.mat
baseClsPool_PD.mat
baseClsPool_Semeion.mat
baseClsPool_SPF.mat
baseClsPool_Texture.mat
baseClsPool_USPS.mat
baseClsPool_VS.mat

There are two variables in the MAT file for each dataset, namely, members and gt. The variable gt is the ground-truth label, which is an N-dimension vector. The variable members is an N x s matrix, where each column of it is a candidate base clustering.


About the code:

The file entitled 'demo_LWEA_and_LWGP.m' is the main file for running LWEA and LWGP. You may change the following settings in order to test the performances of LWEA and LWGP:

1) dataName:	the dataset to be used.
2) M:           the ensemble size.
3) cntTimes:	run LWEA and LWGP for cntTimes times and obtain the average performance.
4) para_theta:	the parameter theta.
5) clsNums:     a vector of positve integers, specifying different numbers of clusters for LWEA and LWGP.

(Please note that M, cntTimes must be positive integers. The parameter para_theta must be greater than zero.)

The execution results and the variable 'bcIdx' will be saved as results.mat (in the results directory). The bcIdx is a cntTimes x M matrix and stores the information of the ensembles. Each row in bcIdx includes M indices for choosing base clusterings in the pool and thus represents an ensemble of M base clusterings. When comparing our approach to other approaches, please make sure that they use the same base clustering settings, i.e., use the ensembles generated by the same 'bcIdx'.
